*   🚀 **Streamlined ML Model Deployment:** Facilitates rapid deployment and lifecycle management of Machine Learning models, seamlessly integrating them with the powerful Back4app BaaS platform for execution.
*   📊 **Performance Monitoring & Analytics:** Implements robust 'Sentinel' capabilities for real-time observation and analysis of ML model performance, resource utilization, and operational health, ensuring optimal service delivery.
*   🔒 **Enhanced Security Protocols:** Designed with security at its forefront, ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and controlled access for ML services and sensitive data, leveraging Back4app's secure infrastructure.
*   🌐 **Scalable Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) Integration:** Fully leverages Back4app's scalable, reliable, and performant backend services, providing a solid foundation for enterprise-grade ML applications.
*   🛠️ **TypeScript-First Development:** Built entirely with TypeScript, promoting type safety, enhancing code maintainability, and delivering enterprise-grade code quality and developer experience.

## System Requirements

To effectively utilize or contribute to Sentinel-ML-Back4app, the following system requirements are necessary:

*   **Node.js:** Version 16.x or higher.
*   **npm or Yarn:** Latest stable version for dependency management.
*   **Web Browser:** A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari) is required for accessing the platform's user interface.
*   **Back4app Account:** An active Back4app account is essential for deploying and managing ML services.
*   **Development Environment (Optional):** For local development or contributions, a suitable Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code is recommended.

## Installation & Configuration

Follow these steps to set up and configure Sentinel-ML-Back4app:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dakshx07/Sentinel-ML-Back4app.git
    cd Sentinel-ML-Back4app
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Configuration:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
    *   Populate this file with your Back4app API credentials and any other required environment variables.
        ```dotenv
        VITE_BACK4APP_APP_ID=YOUR_BACK4APP_APPLICATION_ID
        VITE_BACK4APP_CLIENT_KEY=YOUR_BACK4APP_JAVASCRIPT_KEY
        # Add other environment variables as needed for specific functionalities
        ```
    *   Ensure that these keys are kept confidential and are not committed to public repositories.

4.  **Start Development Server (Optional):**
    To run the application in development mode with hot-reloading:
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    This will typically launch the application on `http://localhost:3000`.

5.  **Build for Production:**
    To compile the application for production deployment:
    ```bash
    pnpm build
    ```
    The optimized production assets will be generated in the `dist` directory.

## Usage Guide

This section outlines the general workflow for interacting with the Sentinel-ML-Back4app platform:

1.  **Accessing the Platform:**
    *   If running locally: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by your Vite configuration) in your web browser.
    *   If deployed: Access the designated URL for your Sentinel-ML-Back4app instance.

2.  **Developing ML Logic:**
    *   Utilize the integrated code editor to write or paste your Machine Learning model's logic, leveraging the comprehensive support for both Python and JavaScript.
    *   The editor provides real-time syntax checking, intelligent autocompletion, and other developer-friendly features to enhance productivity.

3.  **Deployment to Back4app:**
    *   Follow the intuitive in-platform instructions to link your developed code artifacts to your Back4app application.
    *   Initiate the deployment process, which securely packages and pushes your ML service to the Back4app cloud functions or serverless environment.

4.  **Monitoring and Management:**
    *   Access the 'Sentinel' dashboard to observe key performance indicators (KPIs) of your deployed models, including invocation rates, latency, and error metrics.
    *   Review detailed logs, analyze error rates, and monitor resource consumption to ensure the optimal and efficient operation of your ML services.

## Support & Service Level Agreement (SLA)

We are committed to providing robust support for Sentinel-ML-Back4app.
